(* The description of part A of Day 13 tries to tempt you
   into an iterative solution, promising that each button
   takes less than 100 presses, but knowing the way these
   puzzles work, I was pretty sure part B would not be
   solveable that way, so I went ahead with a linear algebra
   solution. Here's the basic equation:

   x1 y1    a     x1*a + y1 * b
         *     =
   x2 y2    b     x2*a + y2 * b

   We know what the values on the right are supposed to be
   so we just need to find a and b. You do this by inverting
   the left matrix and multiplying by the matrix of the
   desired results.

   So, the first example has:
   Button A: X+94, Y+34
   Button B: X+22, Y+67
   Prize: X=8400, Y=5400

   We want to find a and b such that 94 * a + 22 * b = 8400
   and 34 * a + 67 * y = 5400. This means we have to set up the
   initial matrix a little differently:

   x1 x2   a    8400
         *   =
   y1 y2   b    5400

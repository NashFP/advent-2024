(* Day 10 involves finding a path on a grid.
   Since you start at grid points with a value of 0 and each
   move is to a grid point that is one higher, it is easy to
   just do a fold over the destination heights in order
   looking for any current coordinates that can move to
   that height.

   Part b is actually simpler because I just remove the filter
   that looks for unique coordinates (the filter is implemented
   by the reduce function in find_peak).

   The basic process is:
   Find all the starting coordinates - those where the grid value
   is 0.

   For each starting coordinate, either find all peaks (part a) or
   find all unique paths to each peak (part b). We fold over a list
   of heights from 1..9, and use the advance function to take the
   existing coordinate(s) and find all new coordinates that move to
   the target height. For part a, we reduce this to unique coordinates,
   while for part b we don't because each new coordinate actually
   represents a separate path.

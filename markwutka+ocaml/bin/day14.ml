(* Part A was pretty easy, just multiplying the robot's
   move delta by the number of seconds and doing a modulo
   to keep it in range (I had to make a modulo func that always
   returned a positive number).

   For part B, I started off looking at manual frames, and
   noticed something recurring every 103 frames, starting at
   frame 1, and something else recurring every 101 frames
   starting at 48. I just made a function to find out when
   those two would intersect at the same frame and that
   was the answer. But it occurs to me that 1 and 48 might
   be unique to my puzzle, so I reverted back to a previous
   solution where I just searched for a long string of X's
   in the resulting tree.

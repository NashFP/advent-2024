(* My basic strategy here is to take a pattern and the
   set of towels, see if the pattern starts with any of the
   towels and make a new set of patterns with those towels
   removed from the front.

   If the patterns are just a list, there are numerous
   duplicates. Switching to a set, I was able to eliminate the
   duplicate patterns that could be produced, but then in order
   to count the number of combinations, I turned the set
   into a map where the key is the pattern and the value is
   the number of ways I got to that pattern.

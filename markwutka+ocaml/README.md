# Mark Wutka's OCaml solutions for Advent of Code 2024

This project uses the Dune build system. There are some
common utils in the lib directory, and each day's problem
is in the bin directory. I put the data files in the data
directory but do not check them in here.

To run day1, for example, you can do:

```
dune exec day1
```

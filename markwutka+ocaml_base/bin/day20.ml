(*
  There's not much trickery to this. I originally kept
  an array whose elements were either 0 meaning the
  cell isn't on the path, or the cell's distance along
  the path. Then I realized that since the path never
  intersects itself, I can figure out the next item
  on the path by keeping track of the previous position
  and making sure I don't go backwards. That allowed
  me to store the distance along the path in the path
  itself and not have to have a grid structure at all.

  When looking for the cheats, a cheat can actually
  cross an existing part of the path, so you can just
  use Manhattan distance for the distance between any
  two points along the path.

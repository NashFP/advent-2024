(* This feels just ugly, and took me a long time.
   Basically, it's Dijkstra's algorithm, using a Map as a priority queue
   where the map is keyed/order by path_cost,x,y,direction and the
   map values are pairs of the squares on any path to this point with
   the same cost, and the visited squares for this path.
   I had originally done the visited map wrong where it was included
   in each item in the priority queue, which meant it visited the same
   locations many times. Fixing that changed the runtime from 5-6 minutes
   to 0.04 seconds.
